# DeepDTA: using your own train/test datasets

Here is the modified version of DeepDTA that enables the use of your own training and/or test datasets.

## Data folder

These are two sample datasets that I used as an example. DTC is used as training set and mytest folder contains three example files that your test data should be formatted as.

*   **DTC:** is a subset of data collected from (https://drugtargetcommons.fimm.fi/) that only contains pKd binding affinity values.
    *   [Y](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~hakime.ozturk/source/bindingaff/Y), please make sure to download this file and place it under DTC folder. It stores binding affinity values in pickle format.
    *   since training data values are pKd, predicted values will be pKd as well. You can also change the training set according to your needs. 
    *    for that uncomment line 551 in 'run_experiments.py' file.
    ```py
        #prepare_new_data(FLAGS.train_path, test=False) #Uncomment this if you also have a new training data
    ```
*   **mytest:** 
    *   ***Y.tab:*** tab-seperated binding affinity file (drugs x proteins matrix). 
    
          The number of rows corresponds to the number of drugs and the number of columns is equal to the number of proteins. This can be all 0s if one wants to predict binding affinity values for the unknown data. Or you can simply use the known affinity values for each drug-protein pair in which unknown interactions are indicated as 'nan'. 
          ***Example  Y for predicting unknown protein-drug interactions***
          
                            0 0 0 0 0 0
                            0 0 0 0 0 0
                            0 0 0 0 0 0

          ***Example  Y for predicting known + unknown protein-drug interactions***
          
                            8.1 2 12 nan 15 5
                            4 4.3 5 14 nan nan
                            nan 2.2 5 8 12 nan
          
    *    ***ligands.tab:*** each line contains tab-seperated ligand ID and corresponding SMILES.
    *    ***proteins.fasta:*** fasta file for each protein in the dataset. 
    
    You can modify these according to your own data. 


## Requirements

You'll need to install following in order to run the codes.

*  [Python 3.4 <=](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*  [Keras 2.x](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/)
*  [Tensorflow 1.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
*  numpy
*  matplotlib

You have to place "data" folder under "source" directory. 

# Usage

                          --max_smi_len 100 \
                          --train_path 'data/DTC/' \
                          --test_path 'data/mytest/' \
                          --problem_type 1 \
                          --isLog 0 \
                          --log_dir 'logs/'


```
