The folder for preprocessing codes which generate results in the folder "data/"

The Metz and Davis datasets will be downloaded automatically.

The unpreprocessed Kiba dataset needs to be downloaded manually from "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/ci400709d" 

The Kiba dataset-file is named "ci400709d_si_002.xlsx" and needs to be stored in this directory before running the R-script "preprocess_Kiba.R"
